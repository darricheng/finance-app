# Personal Finance App

A custom-built app to help me better manage my finances.

## Background Info

I've never been the best at managing my finances. When I was young, much of my finances were looked over closely by my parents. That meant my overall financial health from an external point of view looks alright, because there are no glaring issues such as large debts or low savings.

However, their close watch also meant that I didn't develop very strong financial management skills; I have very little idea what I'm doing about my finances. I didn't want to continue down this path, so I started to take action.

The development of this app is but one step in my journey towards better financial management.

## Goals

- Keep track of how I'm keeping to my predefined budget
- Monitor overall spending trends
- Track my income levels

## Tech

Built with Tauri using Svelte because I find that I like developing with both Rust and Svelte, and want to further develop proficiency using them.
